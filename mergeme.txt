What are skills?

Skills are the abilities to perform a task or activity competently. They can be learned, developed, and improved over time. Skills can be classified into many different categories, such as hard skills, soft skills, and cognitive skills.

Hard skills are technical skills that are specific to a particular job or task. They can be measured and quantified, such as proficiency in a software program or the ability to speak a foreign language.

Soft skills are personal qualities that enable people to interact effectively with others. They are often more difficult to measure than hard skills, but they are just as important in the workplace. Some examples of soft skills include communication, teamwork, problem-solving, and leadership.

Cognitive skills are the mental abilities that allow people to think, learn, and solve problems. They include skills such as critical thinking, creativity, and reasoning.
